### Notes:
- Should have made components 
- Check if there's only 1 food pairing, does it make a p tag instead of a ul

### Guide:
## Adding a beer
- Only name is required; easier for testing purposes.



### Scrollbar
- Needs to come back on all sizes

### ShowcaseSlider
- can't highlight text on slides
- Add arrows on the sides of the slide to guide the user, and
  disable cursor swipe(?) for the benefit of the user able to copy text with ease.
- Mash temp unit & duration shows even on entries without them



### Navbar
- 

### AddBeerForm
- <button type="button" onClick={() => appendMashTemp({ temp: { value: "", unit: "celsius" }, duration: "" })} />
- the other append buttons dont have this line, check all of them for this for concurrency "and empty placeholders"
